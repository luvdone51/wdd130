        <p>Hello! My name is Kimberly Hendricks. I am originally from Phoenix, Arizona, but I now reside in Las Vegas,
            NV, and I love working with my mind. I have two children, who are now adults, and three granddaughters who
            are just everything to me. I love my little family and would do anything for them. I am going back to school
            so I can better myself and show my granddaughters that you can pursue your dreams no matter what age you
            are. I am excited to learn more about web design and development and see where it takes me.</p>
