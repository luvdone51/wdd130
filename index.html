        <p>Hello, my name is Kimberly HendricksI am originally from Phoenix, Arizona, but I now reside in Las Vegas, NV.  I love working with my mind. I have two children, who are now adults, and three granddaughters who are just everything to me. I love my little family and would do anything for them. I am going back to school so I can better myself and show my granddaughters that you can pursue your dreams no matter what age you are. I am excited to learn more about web design and development and see where it takes me.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include reading, hiking, and spending time with my family. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes. I am passionate about learning new things and expanding my knowledge in various fields.</p>
