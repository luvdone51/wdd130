    <p> Hello! My name is Kimberly Hendricks. I am originally from Phoenix, Arizona, but I now reside in Las Vegas,
      NV, and I love working with my mind. I have two children, who are now adults, and three granddaughters who
      are just everything to me. I love my little family and would do anything for them. I am going back to school
      so I can better myself and show my granddaughters that you can pursue your dreams no matter what age you
      are. I am excited to learn more about web design and development and see where it takes me. </p>
